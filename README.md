# CurrencyArbitrage
A directed weighted graph that represents exchange rates. Each node of the graph represents a currency (such as dollars) 
and each directed weighted edge represents the exchange rate (the edge weight is what you multiply the from-node by to 
get the corresponding amount of currency in the to-node).
